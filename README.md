# Necessarily-Rank-Maximal-Matching
Rank-maximality is a robust optimality criterion in resource allocation problems.The repo presents a comprehensive literature survey on Rank-Maximality and the online version of this allocation problem called Necessarily rank-maximal matching. We propose a novel query protocol and an original algorithm for NRM matchings. All resources are attached.
