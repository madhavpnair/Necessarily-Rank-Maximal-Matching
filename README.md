# Necessarily Rank-Maximal Matching (NRMM)

Rank-maximality is a robust optimality criterion for resource allocation problems.

This repository provides a comprehensive literature survey of Rank-Maximality and addresses the online version of this allocation problem, known as Necessarily Rank-Maximal Matching.

## Key Contributions

* **Literature Survey:** We discuss the entire history of the rank-maximal matchings starting from its definition.<br>
Query models and algorithms for RMMs and NRMMs are documented analysing the correctness and complexities.<br>
* **RASC Model:** Introduction of the **Rank-Aware Set-Compare (RASC)** model, a custom-engineered modification of the vanilla set-compare query protocol designed for refined preference elicitation.
* **Original Algorithm:** Implementation of a novel online algorithm based on the RASC model.
